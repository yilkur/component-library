# React + TypeScript Component Library

Welcome to my React and TypeScript component library! This project was built as part of a solo challenge for the Scrimba Frontend Developer Career Path. Itâ€™s my first dive into TypeScript and my first time using Vite â€” which I chose because itâ€™s fast and all the rage right now! ðŸ˜„

## About the Project
This library contains reusable React components designed with TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience. The goal was to create a solid foundation for building UI elements that are modular and easy to maintain.

## Features
- Built with **React** and **TypeScript** for type-safe components
- Powered by **Vite** for a fast development experience
- Modular and reusable UI components (cards, testimonials, etc..)
- Simple and clean project setup for learning and experimentation

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/yilkur/component-library.git`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Explore the components in the `src/components` folder!

## What I Learned
- Writing type-safe React components with TypeScript
- Setting up a project with Vite for blazing-fast builds
- Structuring a component library for reusability
- Overcoming challenges like TS Types and configuring eslint

## Next Steps
- Add more components to expand the library
- Improve documentation with usage examples
- Explore advanced TypeScript features for better type inference

Thanks for checking out my project! Feedback is welcome as I continue learning TypeScript and React.
